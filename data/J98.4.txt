Clinical Information

 A non-neoplastic or neoplastic condition affecting the lung. Representative examples of non-neoplastic conditions include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia. Representative examples of neoplastic conditions include benign processes (e.g., respiratory papilloma) and malignant processes (e.g., lung carcinoma and metastatic cancer to the lung).

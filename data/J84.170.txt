Interstitial lung disease with progressive fibrotic phenotype in diseases classified elsewhere

ICD-10-CM Coding Rules

 J84.170  describes the manifestation of an underlying disease, not the disease itself. 

Applicable To Progressive fibrotic interstitial lung disease
Code First Code First Help Certain conditions have both an underlying etiology and multiple body system manifestations due to the underlying etiology. For such conditions, ICD-10-CM has a coding convention that requires the underlying condition be sequenced first followed by the manifestation.  Wherever such a combination exists there is a "use additional code" note at the etiology code, and a  "code first"  note at the manifestation code.  These instructional notes indicate the proper sequencing order of the codes, etiology followed by manifestation. In most cases the manifestation codes will have in the code title, "in diseases classified elsewhere."  Codes with this title are a component of the etiology/manifestation convention. The code title indicates that it is a manifestation code. "In diseases classified elsewhere" codes are never permitted to be used as first listed or principle diagnosis codes. They must be used in conjunction with an underlying condition code and they must be listed following the underlying condition. underlying disease, such as: lung diseases due to external agents ( J60-J70   ICD-10-CM Range  J60-J70 Lung diseases due to external agents Type 2 Excludes asthma ( J45.- ) malignant neoplasm of bronchus and lung ( C34.- ) J60  Coalworker's pneumoconiosis J61  Pneumoconiosis due to asbestos and other...

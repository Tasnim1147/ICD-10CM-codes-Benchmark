ICD-10-CM Coding Rules

 J91.8  describes the manifestation of an underlying disease, not the disease itself. 

Code First Code First Help Certain conditions have both an underlying etiology and multiple body system manifestations due to the underlying etiology. For such conditions, ICD-10-CM has a coding convention that requires the underlying condition be sequenced first followed by the manifestation.  Wherever such a combination exists there is a "use additional code" note at the etiology code, and a  "code first"  note at the manifestation code.  These instructional notes indicate the proper sequencing order of the codes, etiology followed by manifestation. In most cases the manifestation codes will have in the code title, "in diseases classified elsewhere."  Codes with this title are a component of the etiology/manifestation convention. The code title indicates that it is a manifestation code. "In diseases classified elsewhere" codes are never permitted to be used as first listed or principle diagnosis codes. They must be used in conjunction with an underlying condition code and they must be listed following the underlying condition. underlying disease, such as: filariasis ( ICD-10-CM Diagnosis Code  B74.0 Filariasis due to Wuchereria bancrofti 2016   2017   2018   2019   2020   2021   2022   2023   Billable/Specific Code   Applicable To Bancroftian elephantiasis Bancroftian filariasis B74.0- ICD-10-CM Diagnosis Code  B74.9 Filariasis, unspecified 2016   2017   2018   2019   2020   2021   2022   2023   Billable/Specific Code   B74.9 ) influenza ( ICD-10-CM Diagnosis Code  J09.X2 Influenza due to identified novel influenza A virus with other respiratory manifestations 2016   2017   2018   2019   2020   2021   2022   2023   Billable/Specific Code   Applicable To Influenza due to identified novel influenza A virus NOS Influenza due to identified novel influenza A virus with laryngitis Influenza due to identified novel influenza A virus with pharyngitis Influenza due to identified novel influenza A virus with upper respiratory symptoms Use Additional code, if applicable, for associated: pleural effusion ( J91.8 ) sinusitis ( J01.- ) J09.X2 ,  ICD-10-CM Diagnosis Code  J10.1 Influenza due to other identified influenza virus with other respiratory manifestations 2016   2017   2018   2019   2020   2021   2022   2023   Billable/Specific Code   Applicable To Influenza due to other identified influenza virus NOS Influenza due to other identified influenza virus with laryngitis Influenza due to other identified influenza virus with pharyngitis Influenza due to other identified influenza virus with upper respiratory symptoms Use Additional code for associated pleural effusion, if applicable ( J91.8 ) J10.1 ,  ICD-10-CM Diagnosis Code  J11.1 Influenza due to unidentified influenza virus with other respiratory manifestations 2016   2017   2018   2019   2020   2021   2022   2023   Billable/Specific Code   Applicable To Influenza NOS Influenzal laryngitis NOS Influenzal pharyngitis NOS Influenza with upper respiratory symptoms NOS Use Additional code for associated pleural effusion, if applicable ( J91.8 ) J11.1 )

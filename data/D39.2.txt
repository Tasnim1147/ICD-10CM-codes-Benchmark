Clinical Information

 A type of cancer that grows into the muscular wall of the uterus. It is formed after conception (fertilization of an egg by a sperm). It may spread to other parts of the body, such as the vagina, vulva, and lung. 
 A uterine tumor derived from persistent gestational trophoblasts, most likely after a molar pregnancy (hydatidiform mole). Invasive hyadatiform mole develops in about 15% of patients after evacuation of a complete mole and less frequently after other types of gestation. It may perforate the myometrium and erode uterine vessels causing hemorrhage. 
 This term is used when a complete mole or very rarely a partial mole invades the myometrium. Microscopically, villi of hydatidiform mole are present within the myometrium or the myometrial vessels. Patients have persistent or rising hcg levels.

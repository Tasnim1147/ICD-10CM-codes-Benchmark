Drug-induced interstitial lung disorders, unspecified

Use Additional Use Additional Help Certain conditions have both an underlying etiology and multiple body system manifestations due to the underlying etiology. For such conditions the ICD-10-CM has a coding convention that requires the underlying condition be sequenced first followed by the manifestation.  Wherever such a combination exists there is a  "use additional code"  note at the etiology code, and a "code first" note at the manifestation code.  These instructional notes indicate the proper sequencing order of the codes, etiology followed by manifestation. In most cases the manifestation codes will have in the code title, "in diseases classified elsewhere."  Codes with this title are a component of the etiology/manifestation convention. The code title indicates that it is a manifestation code. "In diseases classified elsewhere" codes are never permitted to be used as first listed or principle diagnosis codes. They must be used in conjunction with an underlying condition code and they must be listed following the underlying condition. code for adverse effect, if applicable, to identify drug ( T36-T50   ICD-10-CM Range  T36-T50 Poisoning by, adverse effect of and underdosing of drugs, medicaments and biological substances Code First , for adverse effects, the nature of the adverse effect, such as: adverse effect NOS ( T88.7 ) aspirin gastritis ( K29.- ) blood disorders ( D56 - D76 ) contact dermatitis ( L23 - L25 ) dermatitis due to substances taken internally ( L27.- ) nephropathy ( N14.0- N14.2 ) Includes adverse effect of correct substance properly administered poisoning by overdose of substance poisoning by wrong substance given or taken in error underdosing by (inadvertently) (deliberately) taking less substance than prescribed or instructed Note The drug giving rise to the adverse effect should be identified by use of codes from categories  T36-T50  with fifth or sixth character 5.

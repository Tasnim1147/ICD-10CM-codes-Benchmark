Use Additional Use Additional Help Certain conditions have both an underlying etiology and multiple body system manifestations due to the underlying etiology. For such conditions the ICD-10-CM has a coding convention that requires the underlying condition be sequenced first followed by the manifestation.  Wherever such a combination exists there is a  "use additional code"  note at the etiology code, and a "code first" note at the manifestation code.  These instructional notes indicate the proper sequencing order of the codes, etiology followed by manifestation. In most cases the manifestation codes will have in the code title, "in diseases classified elsewhere."  Codes with this title are a component of the etiology/manifestation convention. The code title indicates that it is a manifestation code. "In diseases classified elsewhere" codes are never permitted to be used as first listed or principle diagnosis codes. They must be used in conjunction with an underlying condition code and they must be listed following the underlying condition. code to identify type of infection, such as: cellulitis of neck ( ICD-10-CM Diagnosis Code  L03.221 Cellulitis of neck 2016   2017   2018   2019   2020   2021   2022   2023   Billable/Specific Code   L03.221 ) sepsis ( ICD-10-CM Diagnosis Code  A40 Streptococcal sepsis 2016   2017   2018   2019   2020   2021   2022   2023   Non-Billable/Non-Specific Code   Code First postprocedural streptococcal sepsis ( T81.4- ) streptococcal sepsis during labor ( O75.3 ) streptococcal sepsis following abortion or ectopic or molar pregnancy ( O03 - O07 ,  O08.0 ) streptococcal sepsis following immunization ( T88.0 ) streptococcal sepsis following infusion, transfusion or therapeutic injection ( T80.2- ) Type 1 Excludes neonatal ( P36.0- P36.1 ) puerperal sepsis ( O85 ) sepsis due to Streptococcus, group D ( A41.81 ) A40 ,  ICD-10-CM Diagnosis Code  A41   A41  Other sepsis   A41.0  Sepsis due to Staphylococcus aureus   A41.01  Sepsis due to Methicillin susceptible Staphyl...

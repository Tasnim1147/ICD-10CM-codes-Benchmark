Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax

Code First Code First Help Certain conditions have both an underlying etiology and multiple body system manifestations due to the underlying etiology. For such conditions, ICD-10-CM has a coding convention that requires the underlying condition be sequenced first followed by the manifestation.  Wherever such a combination exists there is a "use additional code" note at the etiology code, and a  "code first"  note at the manifestation code.  These instructional notes indicate the proper sequencing order of the codes, etiology followed by manifestation. In most cases the manifestation codes will have in the code title, "in diseases classified elsewhere."  Codes with this title are a component of the etiology/manifestation convention. The code title indicates that it is a manifestation code. "In diseases classified elsewhere" codes are never permitted to be used as first listed or principle diagnosis codes. They must be used in conjunction with an underlying condition code and they must be listed following the underlying condition. underlying condition, such as: catamenial pneumothorax due to endometriosis ( ICD-10-CM Diagnosis Code  N80.B Endometriosis of cardiothoracic space 2023 - New Code   Non-Billable/Non-Specific Code   Applicable To Endometriosis of thorax Code Also , if applicable: catamenial hemothorax ( J94.2 ) catamenial pneumothorax ( J93.12 ) N80.B- ) cystic fibrosis ( ICD-10-CM Diagnosis Code  E84   E84  Cystic fibrosis   E84.0  Cystic fibrosis with pulmonary manifestations...

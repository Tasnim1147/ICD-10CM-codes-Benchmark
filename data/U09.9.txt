Code First Code First Help Certain conditions have both an underlying etiology and multiple body system manifestations due to the underlying etiology. For such conditions, ICD-10-CM has a coding convention that requires the underlying condition be sequenced first followed by the manifestation.  Wherever such a combination exists there is a "use additional code" note at the etiology code, and a  "code first"  note at the manifestation code.  These instructional notes indicate the proper sequencing order of the codes, etiology followed by manifestation. In most cases the manifestation codes will have in the code title, "in diseases classified elsewhere."  Codes with this title are a component of the etiology/manifestation convention. The code title indicates that it is a manifestation code. "In diseases classified elsewhere" codes are never permitted to be used as first listed or principle diagnosis codes. They must be used in conjunction with an underlying condition code and they must be listed following the underlying condition. the specific condition related to COVID-19 if known, such as: chronic respiratory failure ( ICD-10-CM Diagnosis Code  J96.1 Chronic respiratory failure 2016   2017   2018   2019   2020   2021   2022   2023   Non-Billable/Non-Specific Code   J96.1- ) loss of smell ( ICD-10-CM Diagnosis Code  R43.8 Other disturbances of smell and taste 2016   2017   2018   2019   2020   2021   2022   2023   Billable/Specific Code   Applicable To Mixed disturbance of smell and taste R43.8 ) loss of taste ( ICD-10-CM Diagnosis Code  R43.8 Other disturbances of smell and taste 2016   2017   2018   2019   2020   2021   2022   2023   Billable/Specific Code   Applicable To Mixed disturbance of smell and taste R43.8 ) multisystem inflammatory syndrome ( ICD-10-CM Diagnosis Code  M35.81 Multisystem inflammatory syndrome 2016   2017   2018   2019   2020   2021   2022   2023   Billable/Specific Code   Applicable To MIS-A MIS-C Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children Pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome PIMS Code First , if applicable, COVID-19 ( U07.1 ) Code Also any associated complications such as: acute hepatic failure ( K72.0- ) acute kidney failure ( N17.- ) acute myocarditis ( I40.- ) acute respiratory distress syndrome ( J80 ) cardiac arrhythmia ( I47 - I49 .-) pneumonia due to COVID-19 ( J12.82 ) severe sepsis ( R65.2- ) viral cardiomyopathy ( B33.24 ) viral pericarditis ( B33.23 ) Use Additional code, if applicable, for: exposure to COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 infection ( Z20.822 ) personal history of COVID-19 ( Z86.16 ) post COVID-19 condition ( U09.9 ) M35.81 ) pulmonary embolism ( ICD-10-CM Diagnosis Code  I26   I26  Pulmonary embolism   I26.0  Pulmonary embolism with acute cor pulmonale   I26.01  Septic pulmonary embolism with acute cor pulm...

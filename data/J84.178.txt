ICD-10-CM Coding Rules

 J84.178  describes the manifestation of an underlying disease, not the disease itself. 

Applicable To Interstitial pneumonia (nonspecific) (usual) due to collagen vascular disease Interstitial pneumonia (nonspecific) (usual) in diseases classified elsewhere Organizing pneumonia due to collagen vascular disease Organizing pneumonia in diseases classified elsewhere
Code First Code First Help Certain conditions have both an underlying etiology and multiple body system manifestations due to the underlying etiology. For such conditions, ICD-10-CM has a coding convention that requires the underlying condition be sequenced first followed by the manifestation.  Wherever such a combination exists there is a "use additional code" note at the etiology code, and a  "code first"  note at the manifestation code.  These instructional notes indicate the proper sequencing order of the codes, etiology followed by manifestation. In most cases the manifestation codes will have in the code title, "in diseases classified elsewhere."  Codes with this title are a component of the etiology/manifestation convention. The code title indicates that it is a manifestation code. "In diseases classified elsewhere" codes are never permitted to be used as first listed or principle diagnosis codes. They must be used in conjunction with an underlying condition code and they must be listed following the underlying condition. underlying disease, such as: progressive systemic sclerosis ( ICD-10-CM Diagnosis Code  M34.0 Progressive systemic sclerosis 2016   2017   2018   2019   2020   2021   2022   2023   Billable/Specific Code   M34.0 ) rheumatoid arthritis ( ICD-10-CM Diagnosis Code  M05.00 Felty's syndrome, unspecified site 2016   2017   2018   2019   2020   2021   2022   2023   Billable/Specific Code   M05.00- ICD-10-CM Diagnosis Code  M06.9 Rheumatoid arthritis, unspecified 2016   2017   2018   2019   2020   2021   2022   2023   Billable/Specific Code   M06.9 ) systemic lupus erythematosis ( ICD-10-CM Diagnosis Code  M32.0 Drug-induced systemic lupus erythematosus 2016   2017   2018   2019   2020   2021   2022   2023   Billable/Specific Code   Use Additional code for adverse effect, if applicable, to identify drug ( T36-T50  with fifth or sixth character 5) M32.0- ICD-10-CM Diagnosis Code  M32.9 Systemic lupus erythematosus, unspecified 2016   2017   2018   2019   2020   2021   2022   2023   Billable/Specific Code   Applicable To SLE NOS Systemic lupus erythematosus NOS Systemic lupus erythematosus without organ involvement M32.9 )

Clinical Information

 A disease caused by potent protein neurotoxins produced by clostridium botulinum which interfere with the presynaptic release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction. Clinical features include abdominal pain, vomiting, acute paralysis (including respiratory paralysis), blurred vision, and diplopia. Botulism may be classified into several subtypes (e.g., food-borne, infant, wound, and others). (from Adams et al., Principles of Neurology, 6th ed, p1208) 
 A neurologic disease caused by the toxin of the bacteria called clostridium botulinum 
 A serious bacterial infection caused by botulinum toxin which is produced by clostridium botulinum. Patients are infected usually by ingestion of contaminated food or wound contamination. It leads to muscle paralysis which may result in respiratory failure. 
 Botulism is a rare but serious illness. The cause is a toxin (poison) made by a bacterium called clostridium botulinum. It occurs naturally in soil. There are several kinds of botulism. foodborne botulism comes from eating foods contaminated with the toxin. Wound botulism happens when a wound infected with the bacteria makes the toxin. It is more common in heroin users. Infant botulism happens when a baby consumes the spores of the bacteria from soil or honey. All forms can be deadly and are medical emergencies.symptoms include double or blurred vision, drooping eyelids, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, dry mouth, and muscle weakness. Treatment may include antitoxins, intensive medical care, or surgery of infected wounds.to prevent botulism:  be very careful when canning foods at home  do not let babies eat honey get prompt medical care for infected wounds  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

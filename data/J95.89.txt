Other postprocedural complications and disorders of respiratory system, not elsewhere classified

Use Additional Use Additional Help Certain conditions have both an underlying etiology and multiple body system manifestations due to the underlying etiology. For such conditions the ICD-10-CM has a coding convention that requires the underlying condition be sequenced first followed by the manifestation.  Wherever such a combination exists there is a  "use additional code"  note at the etiology code, and a "code first" note at the manifestation code.  These instructional notes indicate the proper sequencing order of the codes, etiology followed by manifestation. In most cases the manifestation codes will have in the code title, "in diseases classified elsewhere."  Codes with this title are a component of the etiology/manifestation convention. The code title indicates that it is a manifestation code. "In diseases classified elsewhere" codes are never permitted to be used as first listed or principle diagnosis codes. They must be used in conjunction with an underlying condition code and they must be listed following the underlying condition. code to identify disorder, such as: aspiration pneumonia ( ICD-10-CM Diagnosis Code  J69   J69  Pneumonitis due to solids and liquids   J69.0  Pneumonitis due to inhalation of food and vom...

Type 2 Excludes Type 2 Excludes Help A  type 2 excludes  note represents "not included here". A type 2 excludes note indicates that the condition excluded is not part of the condition it is excluded from but a patient may have both conditions at the same time. When a type 2 excludes note appears under a code it is acceptable to use both the code ( J95.89 ) and the excluded code together.  acute pulmonary insufficiency following thoracic surgery ( ICD-10-CM Diagnosis Code  J95.1 Acute pulmonary insufficiency following thoracic surgery 2016   2017   2018   2019   2020   2021   2022   2023   Billable/Specific Code   Type 2 Excludes Functional disturbances following cardiac surgery ( I97.0 ,  I97.1- ) J95.1 ) postprocedural subglottic stenosis ( ICD-10-CM Diagnosis Code  J95.5 Postprocedural subglottic stenosis 2016   2017   2018   2019   2020   2021   2022   2023   Billable/Specific Code   J95.5 )

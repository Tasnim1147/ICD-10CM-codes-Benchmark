Malignant pleural effusion

ICD-10-CM Coding Rules

 J91.0  describes the manifestation of an underlying disease, not the disease itself. 

Code First Code First Help Certain conditions have both an underlying etiology and multiple body system manifestations due to the underlying etiology. For such conditions, ICD-10-CM has a coding convention that requires the underlying condition be sequenced first followed by the manifestation.  Wherever such a combination exists there is a "use additional code" note at the etiology code, and a  "code first"  note at the manifestation code.  These instructional notes indicate the proper sequencing order of the codes, etiology followed by manifestation. In most cases the manifestation codes will have in the code title, "in diseases classified elsewhere."  Codes with this title are a component of the etiology/manifestation convention. The code title indicates that it is a manifestation code. "In diseases classified elsewhere" codes are never permitted to be used as first listed or principle diagnosis codes. They must be used in conjunction with an underlying condition code and they must be listed following the underlying condition. underlying neoplasm ( C00-D49   ICD-10-CM Range  C00-D49 Neoplasms C00-C14  Malignant neoplasms of lip, oral cavity ...

Clinical Information

 A collection of fluid in the pleural cavity as a result of malignant disease. Malignant pleural effusion fluid often contains free-floating malignant cells. 
 A condition in which cancer causes an abnormal amount of fluid to collect between the thin layers of tissue (pleura) lining the outside of the lung and the wall of the chest cavity. Lung cancer, breast cancer, lymphoma, and leukemia cause most malignant pleural effusions. 
 Presence of fluid in the pleural cavity as a complication of malignant disease. Malignant pleural effusions often contain actual malignant cells.

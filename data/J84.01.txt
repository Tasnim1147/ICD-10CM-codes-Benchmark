Alveolar proteinosis

Approximate Synonyms

 Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis 

Clinical Information

 A pulmonary alveoli-filling disease, characterized by dense phospholipoproteinaceous deposits in the alveoli, cough, and dyspnea. This disease is often related to, congenital or acquired, impaired processing of pulmonary surfactants by alveolar macrophages, a process dependent on granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. 
 A rare lung disorder characterized by the filling of the pulmonary alveoli with proteinaceous material which stains positive with periodic acid-schiff stain. It may be idiopathic or secondary due to hematologic malignancies or the inhalation of mineral dusts. Signs and symptoms include dyspnea, cough and low grade fever. 
 Unknown etiology marked by chronic filling of alveoli with proteinaceous, lipid-rich, granular material consisting of surfactant and debris of necrotic cells.

ICD-10-CM Coding Rules

 J84.03  describes the manifestation of an underlying disease, not the disease itself. 

Applicable To Essential brown induration of lung
Code First Code First Help Certain conditions have both an underlying etiology and multiple body system manifestations due to the underlying etiology. For such conditions, ICD-10-CM has a coding convention that requires the underlying condition be sequenced first followed by the manifestation.  Wherever such a combination exists there is a "use additional code" note at the etiology code, and a  "code first"  note at the manifestation code.  These instructional notes indicate the proper sequencing order of the codes, etiology followed by manifestation. In most cases the manifestation codes will have in the code title, "in diseases classified elsewhere."  Codes with this title are a component of the etiology/manifestation convention. The code title indicates that it is a manifestation code. "In diseases classified elsewhere" codes are never permitted to be used as first listed or principle diagnosis codes. They must be used in conjunction with an underlying condition code and they must be listed following the underlying condition. underlying disease, such as: disorders of iron metabolism ( ICD-10-CM Diagnosis Code  E83.1 Disorders of iron metabolism 2016   2017   2018   2019   2020   2021   2022   2023   Non-Billable/Non-Specific Code   Type 1 Excludes iron deficiency anemia ( D50.- ) sideroblastic anemia ( D64.0- D64.3 ) E83.1- )
Type 1 Excludes Type 1 Excludes Help A  type 1 excludes  note is a pure excludes.  It means "not coded here". A type 1 excludes note indicates that the code excluded should never be used at the same time as  J84.03 . A type 1 excludes note is for used for when two conditions cannot occur together, such as a congenital form versus an acquired form of the same condition. acute idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage in infants [AIPHI] ( ICD-10-CM Diagnosis Code  R04.81 Acute idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage in infants 2016   2017   2018   2019   2020   2021   2022   2023   Billable/Specific Code   Pediatric Dx (0-17 years)   Applicable To AIPHI Acute idiopathic hemorrhage in infants over 28 days old Type 1 Excludes perinatal pulmonary hemorrhage ( P26.- ) von Willebrand disease ( D68.0- ) R04.81 )

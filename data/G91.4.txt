Hydrocephalus in diseases classified elsewhere

ICD-10-CM Coding Rules

 G91.4  describes the manifestation of an underlying disease, not the disease itself. 

Code First Code First Help Certain conditions have both an underlying etiology and multiple body system manifestations due to the underlying etiology. For such conditions, ICD-10-CM has a coding convention that requires the underlying condition be sequenced first followed by the manifestation.  Wherever such a combination exists there is a "use additional code" note at the etiology code, and a  "code first"  note at the manifestation code.  These instructional notes indicate the proper sequencing order of the codes, etiology followed by manifestation. In most cases the manifestation codes will have in the code title, "in diseases classified elsewhere."  Codes with this title are a component of the etiology/manifestation convention. The code title indicates that it is a manifestation code. "In diseases classified elsewhere" codes are never permitted to be used as first listed or principle diagnosis codes. They must be used in conjunction with an underlying condition code and they must be listed following the underlying condition. underlying condition, such as: congenital syphilis ( ICD-10-CM Diagnosis Code  A50.4 Late congenital neurosyphilis [juvenile neurosyphilis] 2016   2017   2018   2019   2020   2021   2022   2023   Non-Billable/Non-Specific Code   Type 1 Excludes Hutchinson's triad ( A50.53 ) Use Additional code to identify any associated mental disorder A50.4- ) neoplasm ( C00-D49   ICD-10-CM Range  C00-D49 Neoplasms C00-C14  Malignant neoplasms of lip, oral cavity ...

Type 1 Excludes Type 1 Excludes Help A  type 1 excludes  note is a pure excludes.  It means "not coded here". A type 1 excludes note indicates that the code excluded should never be used at the same time as  G91.4 . A type 1 excludes note is for used for when two conditions cannot occur together, such as a congenital form versus an acquired form of the same condition. hydrocephalus due to congenital toxoplasmosis ( ICD-10-CM Diagnosis Code  P37.1 Congenital toxoplasmosis 2016   2017   2018   2019   2020   2021   2022   2023   Billable/Specific Code   Code on Newborn Record   Applicable To Hydrocephalus due to congenital toxoplasmosis P37.1 )
